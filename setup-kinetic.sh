# python-ftdi,  python-pip and sudo pip install pylibftdi
# TEST:
#python -m pylibftdi.examples.list_devices
#Should return:
#FTDI:FT245R USB FIFO:A9026EI5
#If you have a USB Relay board attached via USB.

# expect-dev required to get 'unbuffer' which is required by node to spawn ROS commands and get real time stdout data
    # http://stackoverflow.com/a/11337310
    # http://linux.die.net/man/1/unbuffer
# jq allows shell scripts to read .json formatted config files.
# festival and fsetvox-en1 are for text to speech
#libav-tools is for ffmpeg to stream audio to another system.
#zbar-tools for reading QR codes.
#libftdi1 is required by SimpleIDE for the Parallax Propeller board
#libgif-dev is required for roslib in order to build canvas
#rtabmap is for 3D mapping
#pulseaudio pavucontrol are for setting the default microphone. I use this for mycroft among other things
#ros-kinetic-pointcloud-to-laserscan for Scanse Sweep
#ubuntu-xboxdrv is for using an xbox 360 controler with the robot
