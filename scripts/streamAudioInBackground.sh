# The script I use on my remote machine to start this goes like this:
# $cat listenToArlobot.sh
#ssh arlobot 'pkill avconv'
#ssh arlobot '/home/chrisl8/catkin_ws/src/Arlobot/scripts/streamAudioInBackground.sh'
#vlc rtp://234.5.5.5:1234
#ssh arlobot 'pkill avconv'
#
# So it kills any existing instance, starts a new one, runs vlc to listen, and then kills it when done.
#
# If you are missing 'avconv' run 'sudo apt install libav-tools'
#
# If you are missing 'vlc" on your workstation run 'sudo apt install vlc-nox'
